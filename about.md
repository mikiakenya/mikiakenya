### What is MIKIA?
MIKIA is an indigenous people's organization led by a young indigenous leader, committed to revitalizing, preserving, and regenerating Indigenous Traditional Knowledge (ITK) and cultural heritage. We uphold the resilience of indigenous peoples and their deep connection to nature. MIKIA aims to empower indigenous communities amidst external challenges by integrating traditional wisdom with scientific insights, fostering harmonious coexistence with the natural world. Indigenous approaches to living in harmony with nature are the most inclusive globally.

"MIKIA," derived from an indigenous Maasai name meaning "don't take me away," symbolizes our commitment to safeguarding indigenous knowledge, akin to protecting cultural libraries at risk of disappearance.
