### MIKIA
"MIKIA," derived from an indigenous Maasai name meaning "don't take me away," symbolizes our commitment to safeguarding indigenous knowledge, akin to protecting cultural libraries at risk of disappearance. Our mission is to empower traditional knowledge holders to transmit wisdom to future generations, ensuring the preservation and regeneration of Indigenous Traditional Knowledge (ITK) for co-existence with nature, nature conservation, cultural preservation, and knowledge documentation.

MIKIA is an indigenous people's organization led by a young indigenous leader, committed to revitalizing, preserving, and regenerating ITK and cultural heritage. We uphold the resilience of indigenous peoples and their deep connection to nature. MIKIA aims to empower indigenous communities amidst external challenges by integrating traditional wisdom with scientific insights, fostering harmonious coexistence with the natural world. Indigenous approaches to living in harmony with nature are the most inclusive globally.
